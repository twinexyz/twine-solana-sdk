# Twine-Solana SDK

Perhaps, the beginning of an awesomely-efficient, RISC-V-compatible package for all things Solana on Twine!

All functionality in this repo is experimental. Please use the official [Solana-SDK](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave) and its associated crates for any Solana development you do. This code ***SHOULD NOT*** be used in production until we reach version 1.0.
